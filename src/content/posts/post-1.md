summary: "Astro is launching a hosted service in 2024. It's not a web hosting company. It's not a CMS. It's something entirely new for the web ecosystem and it will be available exclusively for Astro. We're calling it: Astro Studio. Astro Studio is a globally-distributed edge data platform, built for Astro. Connect any new or existing Astro project to a dedicated hosted database in seconds. It's fast everywhere, secure, and unbelievably easy-to-use. Astro Studio comes with a generous free tier. This is our first paid product, and we want it to be accessible to everyone who uses Astro. We take this commitment to our users seriously."

Astro Studio comes with a generous free tier. This is our first paid product, and we want it to be accessible to everyone who uses Astro. We take this commitment to our users seriously.Astro Studio will be completely opt-in. Astro will continue to be a great web framework regardless of whether you choose Astro Studio or not.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

If this sounds exciting, join our waitlist! We'll be accepting people into our private beta later this year with a planned public launch in early 2024. We started Astro because we wanted more out of modern web development. This new launch represents Astro's next chapter in our quest to push the web forward through simplicity.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

I can't wait for you to join us.
